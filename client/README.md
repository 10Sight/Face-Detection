# 10Sight Neural Frontend

The visual interface for the Neural Face Detection system. Built for performance and a "wow-factor" aesthetic.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Rich Aesthetics**: Vibrant gradients, dark mode, glassmorphism, and dynamic micro-animations.
- **Neural Visuals**: Custom "Biometric Assembly" effects using all 512 vector dimensions.
- **Responsive Layout**: Enterprise-grade density optimized for Mission Control centers.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + Tailwind (Selective)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Communication**: PeerJS (WebRTC) for remote camera streaming.
